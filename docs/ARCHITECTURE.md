# System Architecture

## Overview
This document provides a detailed overview of the Real-Time Chat Application's architecture, explaining how different components interact and the technical decisions behind the design.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend (ChatAppFrontEndAvalonia)
The frontend is built using Avalonia UI, providing a cross-platform user interface that works seamlessly across desktop, mobile, and web platforms.

#### Key Components:
- **UI Layer**: MVVM architecture with views and view models
- **Service Layer**: Handles communication with backend services
- **State Management**: Manages application state and real-time updates
- **Authentication**: Handles user authentication and session management

### 2. Backend Services

#### 2.1 Azure Functions (ChatAppDatabaseFunctions)
Serverless functions handling data persistence and business logic.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- User management (registration, profile updates)
- Message persistence
- Chat room management
- Data validation and business rules

#### 2.2 SignalR Server
Real-time communication hub managing WebSocket connections.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Message broadcasting
- Presence management
- Connection state handling
- Real-time notifications

### 3. Data Layer (Azure Cosmos DB)

#### Data Models:
- Users
- Messages
- ChatRooms
- UserConnections

#### Key Features:
- Global distribution
- Automatic scaling
- Multi-region writes
- Low latency access

## Communication Flow

1. **User Authentication:**
   ```
   Client -> Azure Functions -> Azure AD B2C -> Client
   ```

2. **Real-time Messaging:**
   ```
   Client -> SignalR Server -> Other Clients
           -> Azure Functions -> Cosmos DB (persistence)
   ```

3. **Data Operations:**
   ```
   Client -> Azure Functions -> Cosmos DB
   ```

## Security

### Authentication
- Azure AD B2C integration
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure token storage

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Chat room-specific permissions
- Message encryption

## Scalability

### Frontend
- Stateless design
- Caching strategies
- Offline support

### Backend
- Auto-scaling Azure Functions
- SignalR Service scaling
- Cosmos DB throughput scaling

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Insights
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics

### Custom Logging
- User actions
- System events
- Error handling

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Run SignalR Server locally
2. Start Azure Functions emulator
3. Launch Avalonia UI application

### Deployment
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Staged deployments
- Automated testing

## Future Considerations

- Message queuing for high load
- Content delivery network integration
- Enhanced security features
- Mobile push notifications
