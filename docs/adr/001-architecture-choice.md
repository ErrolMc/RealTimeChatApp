# ADR 001: Initial Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We needed to design a real-time chat application that would:
- Support multiple platforms (desktop, mobile, web)
- Handle real-time messaging efficiently
- Scale well with increasing users
- Maintain message persistence
- Be cost-effective to operate

## Decision

### 1. Frontend Framework: Avalonia UI
We chose Avalonia UI for the frontend because:
- True cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, WebAssembly)
- Native performance on all platforms
- Modern MVVM architecture support
- Rich UI component library
- Active community and good documentation

### 2. Backend Architecture: Microservices with Azure
We decided to split the backend into two main components:

#### a. Azure Functions
- Serverless architecture for cost optimization
- Automatic scaling
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Easy integration with other Azure services
- Handles data persistence and business logic

#### b. SignalR Service
- Managed service for real-time communication
- WebSocket support with automatic fallback
- Built-in scaling and load balancing
- Simplified client-server communication

### 3. Database: Azure Cosmos DB
Selected for:
- Global distribution capabilities
- Schema-less design for flexibility
- Automatic scaling
- Multi-region writes
- Low latency access
- Built-in backup and restore

## Consequences

### Positive
1. Development Efficiency
   - Shared code between platforms
   - Rapid development with Azure services
   - Simplified deployment process

2. Performance
   - Low latency real-time communication
   - Efficient data access patterns
   - Good user experience across platforms

3. Scalability
   - Automatic scaling at all layers
   - Pay-as-you-go cost model
   - Easy to add new features

### Negative
1. Azure Lock-in
   - Dependent on Azure services
   - Migration to other clouds would be complex

2. Cost Management
   - Need to monitor Azure consumption
   - Cosmos DB can be expensive at scale

3. Complexity
   - Multiple services to manage
   - More complex deployment pipeline
   - Learning curve for team members
